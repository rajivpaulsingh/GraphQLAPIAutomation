 ## Rest Assured
 API automation framework in this repository. Rest Assured is one of the most popular libraries which is highly used in API Test Automation using Java.
 
 ## TestNG
 TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language. The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc. The major advantages of TestNG are:
 - Provides the ability to produce HTML reports
 - Annotations made easy
 - Test cases can be grouped and prioritized
 - Parallel testing is possible
 - Data parametrization is possible
 
 Use testng.xml to run all the tests or group the tests based on the priority, classifications, smokes or regression. Its very helpful.
